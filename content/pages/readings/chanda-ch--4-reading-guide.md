**Read Chanda, Ch. 4**

**Consider:**

1.  Chanda equates NGOs such as Human Rights Watch with missionaries since both are agents of globalization.  What qualities do they share?  How are they different?
2.  Did your reading of Chanda change how you conceive of the role of missionaries? How?
3.  Look carefully at the {{% resource_link "ff87a760-7619-4269-87a7-ae8fc2e85a71" "faces painted on the caves in Dunhuang, China" %}} and read "{{% resource_link "7c2b2c72-cd03-47ff-a27e-8b417a41fa5d" "A Brief Introduction of Dunhuang" %}}" as well. Consider the role of missionaries as travelers and reporters.
4.  What kinds of cultural bridges were formed by missionaries? Why were they often important in the resistance to colonialism?
5.  What role did missionaries have in the anti slave movement?
